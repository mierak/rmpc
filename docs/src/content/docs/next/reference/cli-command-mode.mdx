Rmpc also features a basic command line interface to support scripting and headless control of mpd without a need for additional tools.

To view the available commands run `rmpc --help`.

These commands are also available in the TUI mode by pressing `CommandMode` bind (`:` by default).

Additionally, these commands can also be bound to a key using the `Command` action as <a href={path("configuration/keybinds#global")}>described here</a>

You can also get help for a specific command by running the command with `--help`. For example `rmpc toggle-output --help`.

```bash frame=none showLineNumbers=false

- Window manager integration
- Media key bindings
- Automation scripts
- Headless control

### Available Remote Commands

```bash
rmpc remote <COMMAND>

Commands:
  indexlrc    Notify rmpc that a new lyrics file has been added
  status      Display a message in the status bar

  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --pid <PID>  PID of the rmpc instance to send the remote command to. If not provided, rmpc will try to notify all the running instances
  -h, --help       Print help
```

### Examples

```bash
# Emulate pressing 'p' (play/pause)
rmpc remote keybind p

# Switch to the Queue tab directly
rmpc remote switch-tab "Queue"

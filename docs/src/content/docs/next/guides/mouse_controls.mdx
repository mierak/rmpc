Rmpc provides some basic mouse controls. These are meant to be complementary to the keybinds, not to replace
keyboard controls.

### Tabs with multiple panes

-   Clicking on a split changes focus

### Progress bar

-   Clicking on the progress bar seeks the currently playing song

### Tab bar

-   Click on a tab to switch
-   Scroll to switch to next/previous tab

### Header

-   Left click to toggle play/pause
-   Scroll up/down to raise/lower volume by your <a href={path("configuration/#volume_step")}>volume_step</a>

### Queue Pane

-   Scrolling in the table is supported
-   Left click to select the song under cursor
-   Double click to play the song under cursor
-   Middle click to remove the song under cursor from the queue

### Browser Panes (Albums, Artists, AlbumArtists, Playlists)

-   Scrolling in the list
-   **Scrollbar is interactive when content exceeds the visible area**: you can click or drag the scrollbar to jump to any position in the list. Clicking the bottom of the scrollbar always selects the last item. The scrollbar is not interactive for small lists that fit in the viewport.
-   Double click item in the middle column to open directory/add song to queue
-   Moddle click item in the middle column to add the whole directory(or single song) to queue
-   Click the right column to open directory/add song to queue
-   Click the left column to go up a level

### Search Pane

-   Works in similar fashion as browser panes
-   **Scrollbar is interactive in the results phase**: when viewing search results, you can click or drag the scrollbar to jump to any position in the list (same behavior as browser panes)
-   Double click text/filter inputs or reset button to activate

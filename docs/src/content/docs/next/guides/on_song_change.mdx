Rmpc provides <a href={path("configuration#on_song_change")}>on_song_change</a> property in the config file
which can be used to run a command whenever the song changes. This can be used for various purposes
like showing a desktop notification, automatic lyrics download and more.

All song metadata are available to the script as environment variables. For example `$TITLE`, `$FILE`, `$DURATION`, etc.

Additional environment variables available to the script are:

- `$VERSION` - rmpc's version
- `$PID` - intended for use with the `remote` command and allows it to target specific rmpc instance
- `$LRC_FILE` - contains the path where rmpc expects to find the lrc file
- `$HAS_LRC` - indicates whether any lyrics were found for the current song.
- `$PREV_SONG` - file path of the previous song, if any, use `rmpc song --path "$PREV_SONG"` to query its metadata
- `$PREV_ELAPSED` - how much of the previous song was really played, in seconds

## Desktop notification on song change

Assuming you have a notification daemon with support for images like [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) running.

<Steps>
1. Create a script and place it somewhere. For example `~/.config/rmpc/notify`. Below is an example of such script.
Edit it to your needs or create a new one.

    ```bash title=~/.config/rmpc/notify
    #!/usr/bin/env sh

    # Directory where to store temporary data
    TMP_DIR="/tmp/rmpc"

    # Ensure the directory is created
    mkdir -p "$TMP_DIR"

    # Where to temporarily store the album art received from rmpc
    ALBUM_ART_PATH="$TMP_DIR/notification_cover"

    # Path to fallback album art if no album art is found by rmpc/mpd
    # Change this to your needs
    DEFAULT_ALBUM_ART_PATH="$TMP_DIR/default_album_art.jpg"

    # Save album art of the currently playing song to a file
    if ! rmpc albumart --output "$ALBUM_ART_PATH"; then
        # Use default album art if rmpc returns non-zero exit code
        ALBUM_ART_PATH="${DEFAULT_ALBUM_ART_PATH}"
    fi

    # Send the notification
    notify-send -i "${ALBUM_ART_PATH}" "Now Playing" "$ARTIST - $TITLE"
    ```

2.  Make the script executable

    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.config/rmpc/notify
    ```

3.  In your rmpc's `config.ron` specify <a href={path("configuration#on_song_change")}>on_song_change</a> property
    and point it at location of the script from step 1.

        ```rust title=config.ron
        #![enable(implicit_some)]
        #![enable(unwrap_newtypes)]
        #![enable(unwrap_variant_newtypes)]
        (
            address: "/tmp/mpd_socket",
            on_song_change: ["~/.config/rmpc/notify"],
        ...

        ```

4.  Restart rmpc

## Track song play count

This allows you to track and display song's play count in the queue table (or header). Please note that rmpc has to be running
for the script to execute and increment the play count.

<Steps>
    1. Configure [sticker_file](https://mpd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mpd.conf.5.html#optional-parameters) in your `mpd.conf`

    2. Create a script and place it somewhere. For example `~/.config/rmpc/playcount` and make the script executable. Or append it to an existing `on_song_change` script.

    3. Increment playCount sticker on the song inside the script. (requires jq)
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env sh

        sticker=$(rmpc sticker get "$FILE" "playCount" | jq -r '.value')
        if [ -z "$sticker" ]; then
            rmpc sticker set "$FILE" "playCount" "1"
        else
            rmpc sticker set "$FILE" "playCount" "$((sticker + 1))"
        fi
        ```

    4. Change your `config.ron` to execute the script you created on song change
        ```rust title=config.ron
        #![enable(implicit_some)]
        #![enable(unwrap_newtypes)]
        #![enable(unwrap_variant_newtypes)]
        (
            address: "/tmp/mpd_socket",
            on_song_change: ["~/.config/rmpc/playcount"],
        ...

        ```
    5. Change your theme to include play count sticker, for example in the queue table

        ```rust title=theme.ron
        #![enable(implicit_some)]
        #![enable(unwrap_newtypes)]
        #![enable(unwrap_variant_newtypes)]
        (
            song_table_format: [
                (
                    ...
                ),
                (
                    prop: (kind: Sticker("playCount"), default: (kind: Text("0"))),
                    width: "9",
                    alignment: Right,
                    label: "Playcount"
                ),
                (
                    ...
                ),
            ],
        ...

        ```

</Steps>

## Automatically fetch lyrics

Provided by [wvffle on github](https://github.com/mierak/rmpc/issues/230). This script allows you to automatically
download lrc files from [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net). Status message is also displayed in rmpc when the operation
finishes. The script assumes you have your `lyrics_dir` configured. The script is just an example and you are encouraged
to create your own!

```bash
#!/bin/env sh

LRCLIB_INSTANCE="https://lrclib.net"

if [ "$HAS_LRC" = "false" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$LRC_FILE")"

    LYRICS="$(curl -X GET -sG \
        -H "Lrclib-Client: rmpc-$VERSION" \
        --data-urlencode "artist_name=$ARTIST" \
        --data-urlencode "track_name=$TITLE" \
        --data-urlencode "album_name=$ALBUM" \
        "$LRCLIB_INSTANCE/api/get" | jq -r '.syncedLyrics')"

    if [ -z "$LYRICS" ]; then
        rmpc remote --pid "$PID" status "Failed to download lyrics for $ARTIST - $TITLE" --level error
        exit
    fi

    if [ "$LYRICS" = "null" ]; then
        rmpc remote --pid "$PID" status "Lyrics for $ARTIST - $TITLE not found" --level warn
        exit
    fi

    echo "[ar:$ARTIST]" >"$LRC_FILE"
    {
        echo "[al:$ALBUM]"
        echo "[ti:$TITLE]"
    } >>"$LRC_FILE"
    echo "$LYRICS" | sed -E '/^\[(ar|al|ti):/d' >>"$LRC_FILE"

    rmpc remote --pid "$PID" indexlrc --path "$LRC_FILE"
    rmpc remote --pid "$PID" status "Downloaded lyrics for $ARTIST - $TITLE" --level info
fi
```

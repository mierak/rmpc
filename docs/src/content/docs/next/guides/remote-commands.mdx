rmpc provides powerful remote command capabilities that allow you to control a running rmpc instance from the command line. this is especially useful for scripting and window manager integration.

## overview

the remote command system allows you to:
- **emulate key presses** (`keybind`) - trigger any keybind as if pressed in the interface
- **execute actions directly** (`command`) - run specific commands like switching tabs or playing music
- **target specific instances** - send commands to a particular rmpc process by pid

## usage

all remote commands follow this pattern:

```bash
rmpc remote [--pid <pid>] <command> <args>
```

if `--pid` is not specified, the command will be sent to all running rmpc instances.

## keybind command

the `keybind` command emulates pressing a key combination in the running rmpc interface.

### syntax

```bash
rmpc remote keybind <key>
```

### examples

```bash
# press 'p' (typically play/pause)
rmpc remote keybind p
```

### common key examples

```bash
# basic navigation
rmpc remote keybind j  # move down
rmpc remote keybind k  # move up
rmpc remote keybind h  # move left
rmpc remote keybind l  # move right

# playback control
rmpc remote keybind p      # toggle play/pause
rmpc remote keybind s      # stop playback
rmpc remote keybind ">"    # next track
rmpc remote keybind "<"    # previous track

# tab switching (numbers)
rmpc remote keybind 1      # switch to queue tab
rmpc remote keybind 2      # switch to directories tab
rmpc remote keybind 3      # switch to artists tab
rmpc remote keybind 4      # switch to album artists tab
rmpc remote keybind 5      # switch to albums tab
rmpc remote keybind 6      # switch to playlists tab
rmpc remote keybind 7      # switch to search tab

# volume control
rmpc remote keybind "."    # volume up
rmpc remote keybind ","    # volume down

# seek control
rmpc remote keybind f      # seek forward
rmpc remote keybind b      # seek backward

# modes
rmpc remote keybind z      # toggle repeat
rmpc remote keybind x      # toggle random
rmpc remote keybind c      # toggle consume
rmpc remote keybind v      # toggle single

# help and info
rmpc remote keybind "~"       # Show help
rmpc remote keybind I         # Show current song info
rmpc remote keybind O         # Show outputs
rmpc remote keybind P         # Show decoders
```

### Key Format Notes

For special keys, use the angle bracket format to ensure proper recognition:

```bash
# Correct formats for special keys
rmpc remote keybind "<CR>"     # Enter key
rmpc remote keybind "<Space>"  # Space key  
rmpc remote keybind "<Esc>"    # Escape key
rmpc remote keybind "<Tab>"    # Tab key
rmpc remote keybind "<BS>"     # Backspace key

# Modifiers use angle brackets too
rmpc remote keybind "<C-p>"    # Ctrl+p
rmpc remote keybind "<S-CR>"   # Shift+Enter
rmpc remote keybind "<A-h>"    # Alt+h
```

## Command Action

The `command` command executes specific actions or commands directly, bypassing the need for key presses.

### Syntax

```bash
rmpc remote command <ACTION>
```

### Tab Switching

Switch between tabs using the `SwitchToTab` action:

```bash
# Switch to Queue tab
rmpc remote command 'SwitchToTab("Queue")'

# Switch to Directories tab  
rmpc remote command 'SwitchToTab("Directories")'

# Switch to Artists tab
rmpc remote command 'SwitchToTab("Artists")'

# Switch to Albums tab
rmpc remote command 'SwitchToTab("Albums")'

# Switch to Lyrics tab
rmpc remote command 'SwitchToTab("Lyrics")'

# Switch to any custom tab name
rmpc remote command 'SwitchToTab("My Custom Tab")'
```

### MPD Commands

Execute any CLI command that rmpc supports:

```bash
# Playback control
rmpc remote command play
rmpc remote command pause
rmpc remote command next
rmpc remote command prev
rmpc remote command stop

# Volume control
rmpc remote command 'volume 50'
rmpc remote command 'volume +10'
rmpc remote command 'volume -5'

# Queue management
rmpc remote command clear
rmpc remote command 'add artist/album/song.mp3'

# Seek commands  
rmpc remote command 'seek +30'
rmpc remote command 'seek -10'
rmpc remote command 'seek 120'
```

## Other Remote Commands

Besides `keybind` and `command`, rmpc supports a few other remote commands:

### Status Messages

Display custom messages in the rmpc status bar:

```bash
# Show an info message for 5 seconds (default)
rmpc remote status "Hello from script!"

# Show an error message for 10 seconds
rmpc remote status --level error --timeout 10000 "Something went wrong"

# Show a warning message
rmpc remote status --level warn "Check your config"
```

### Lyrics Index

Notify rmpc about new lyrics files:

```bash
# Tell rmpc to index a new .lrc file
rmpc remote indexlrc --path /path/to/song.lrc
```

### Set Commands

Update configuration in a running rmpc instance:

```bash
# Update theme from file
rmpc remote set theme /path/to/new-theme.ron

# Update theme from stdin
cat new-theme.ron | rmpc remote set theme -
```

## Targeting Specific Instances

If you have multiple rmpc instances running, you can target a specific one using the `--pid` option:

```bash
# Find rmpc processes
ps aux | grep rmpc

# Send command to specific instance
rmpc remote --pid 12345 keybind p
rmpc remote --pid 12345 command 'SwitchToTab("Lyrics")'
```

## Error Handling

Remote commands will fail silently if:
- No rmpc instance is running
- The specified PID doesn't exist
- Invalid key format is provided
- Invalid command syntax is used
- Tab name doesn't exist in your configuration

Check the rmpc logs for detailed error messages if commands aren't working as expected.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use quotes for complex commands**: Always quote commands with spaces or special characters
- **Check keybind configuration**: The remote keybind command uses your configured keybinds from your config file
- **Test interactively first**: Try commands manually before adding them to scripts  
- **Consider tab names**: Make sure tab names in `SwitchToTab` match your configuration exactly (case-sensitive)

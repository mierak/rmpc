rmpc provides powerful remote command capabilities that allow you to control a running rmpc instance from the command line. this is especially useful for scripting and window manager integration.

## overview

the remote command system allows you to:
- **emulate key presses** (`keybind`) - trigger any keybind as if pressed in the interface
- **send status messages** - display custom messages in the status bar
- **target specific instances** - send commands to a particular rmpc process by pid

## usage

all remote commands follow this pattern:

```bash
rmpc remote [--pid <pid>] <command> <args>
```

if `--pid` is not specified, the command will be sent to all running rmpc instances.

## keybind command

the `keybind` command emulates pressing a key combination in the running rmpc interface.

### syntax

```bash
rmpc remote keybind <key>
```

### examples

```bash
# press 'p' (typically play/pause)
rmpc remote keybind p
```

### common key examples

```bash
# basic navigation
rmpc remote keybind j  # move down
rmpc remote keybind k  # move up
rmpc remote keybind h  # move left
rmpc remote keybind l  # move right

# playback control
rmpc remote keybind p      # toggle play/pause
rmpc remote keybind s      # stop playback
rmpc remote keybind ">"    # next track
rmpc remote keybind "<"    # previous track

# tab switching (numbers)
rmpc remote keybind 1      # switch to queue tab
rmpc remote keybind 2      # switch to directories tab
rmpc remote keybind 3      # switch to artists tab
rmpc remote keybind 4      # switch to album artists tab
rmpc remote keybind 5      # switch to albums tab
rmpc remote keybind 6      # switch to playlists tab
rmpc remote keybind 7      # switch to search tab

# volume control
rmpc remote keybind "."    # volume up
rmpc remote keybind ","    # volume down

# seek control
rmpc remote keybind f      # seek forward
rmpc remote keybind b      # seek backward

# modes
rmpc remote keybind z      # toggle repeat
rmpc remote keybind x      # toggle random
rmpc remote keybind c      # toggle consume
rmpc remote keybind v      # toggle single

# help and info
rmpc remote keybind "~"       # Show help
rmpc remote keybind I         # Show current song info
rmpc remote keybind O         # Show outputs
rmpc remote keybind P         # Show decoders
```

### Key Format Notes

For special keys, use the angle bracket format to ensure proper recognition:

```bash
# Correct formats for special keys
rmpc remote keybind "<CR>"     # Enter key
rmpc remote keybind "<Space>"  # Space key  
rmpc remote keybind "<Esc>"    # Escape key
rmpc remote keybind "<Tab>"    # Tab key
rmpc remote keybind "<BS>"     # Backspace key

# Modifiers use angle brackets too
rmpc remote keybind "<C-p>"    # Ctrl+p
rmpc remote keybind "<S-CR>"   # Shift+Enter
rmpc remote keybind "<A-h>"    # Alt+h
```

## Other Remote Commands

Besides `keybind`, rmpc supports several other remote commands:

### Status Messages

Display custom messages in the rmpc status bar:

```bash
# Show an info message for 5 seconds (default)
rmpc remote status "Hello from script!"

# Show an error message for 10 seconds
rmpc remote status --level error --timeout 10000 "Something went wrong"

# Show a warning message
rmpc remote status --level warn "Check your config"
```

### Lyrics Index

Notify rmpc about new lyrics files:

```bash
# Tell rmpc to index a new .lrc file
rmpc remote indexlrc --path /path/to/song.lrc
```

### Set Commands

Update configuration in a running rmpc instance:

```bash
# Update theme from file
rmpc remote set theme /path/to/new-theme.ron

# Update theme from stdin
cat new-theme.ron | rmpc remote set theme -
```

## Targeting Specific Instances

If you have multiple rmpc instances running, you can target a specific one using the `--pid` option:

```bash
# Find rmpc processes
ps aux | grep rmpc

# Send command to specific instance
rmpc remote --pid 12345 keybind p
rmpc remote --pid 12345 status "Hello from specific instance"
```

## Error Handling

Remote commands will fail silently if:
- No rmpc instance is running
- The specified PID doesn't exist
- Invalid key format is provided
- Tab name doesn't exist in your configuration (for tab switching keybinds)

Check the rmpc logs for detailed error messages if commands aren't working as expected.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use quotes for special characters**: Always quote keys with special characters like `">"` or `"<"` or `"<Tab>"`
- **Check keybind configuration**: The remote keybind command uses your configured keybinds from your config file
- **Test interactively first**: Try commands manually before adding them to scripts

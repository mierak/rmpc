Rmpc is a beautiful, modern and configurable terminal based Music Player Daemon client. It was inspired by ncmpcpp
and aims to provide an alternative with support for album art through kitty image protocol without any ugly hacks.
It also features ranger/lf inspired browsing of songs and other goodies.

## Main Features

- Album cover art display if your terminal supports either of Kitty, Sixel, Iterm2 protocols, or via ueberzuggpp
- Cava integration for music visualisation
- Support for [synchronized lyrics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)>)
- Ability to play music from YouTube
- Configurable (T)UI
    - Configure what information(if any!) is displayed in the header
    - Configure what columns are displayed on the queue pane
    - Completely customize what tabs are rendered and mix and match their content
    - Create any color theme you want
    - Every keybind can be changed, vim-like by default
- Ranger/LF-like three-column browser through your music library
- Basic playlist management
- Support scripting through basic CLI mode and script hooks
- **Remote control** - Send commands to running rmpc instances (useful for window manager integration).

### Command line interface

Some basic features are also available on the command line. Use `rmpc --help` to get a list of available commands or
check out the <a href={path("reference/cli-command-mode")}>CLI reference</a>.

Rmpc also supports **remote commands** that allow you to control running instances from scripts, or other terminal sessions. For example:

```bash
# Emulate pressing the play/pause key
rmpc remote keybind p

# Switch to Queue tab directly (case-insensitive)
rmpc remote switch-tab "Queue"
rmpc remote switch-tab "queue"    # same as above

# Switch to Queue tab (number 1 key)
rmpc remote keybind 1

# Next track
rmpc remote keybind ">"

# Volume up
rmpc remote keybind "."
```

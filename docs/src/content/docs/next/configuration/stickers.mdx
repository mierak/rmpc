Rmpc uses MPD's stickers for some of its functionality like rating, liked status and might use more
in the future.

These stickers are simple key-value pairs attached to songs and can be used to store arbitrary data.
You must have [sticker_file](https://mpd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mpd.conf.5.html#optional-parameters)
set in your MPD's configuration to use this functionality.

You can display these stickers using the `Sticker("<name>")` property.

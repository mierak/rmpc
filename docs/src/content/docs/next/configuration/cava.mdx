Rmpc supports music visualisation via [Cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava).

## Setup

First ensure that Cava is installed on your system and available on your `$PATH`.
After that you need to setup Cava, MPD and rmpc to talk to each other.

<Steps>

1.  Configure MPD to output data to a FIFO. This goes in your `mpd.conf`

    ```
    audio_output {
       type   "fifo"
       name   "my_fifo"
       path   "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
       format "44100:16:2"
    }
    ```

2.  Configure rmpc and by extension Cava. This goes in your `config.ron`. The most important bit here is
    the input, this has to reflect your `mpd.conf` from step one. These settings are passed directly to cava
    so please refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/karlstav/cava/blob/master/example_files/config)
    for more info. Most of these options do not have to be provided and have sensible defaults.

    ```rust
    cava: (
        framerate: 60, // default 60
        autosens: true, // default true
        sensitivity: 100, // default 100
        lower_cutoff_freq: 50, // not passed to cava if not provided
        higher_cutoff_freq: 10000, // not passed to cava if not provided
        input: (
            method: Fifo,
            source: "/tmp/mpd.fifo",
            sample_rate: 44100,
            channels: 2,
            sample_bits: 16,
        ),
        smoothing: (
            noise_reduction: 77, // default 77
            monstercat: false, // default false
            waves: false, // default false
        ),
        // this is a list of floating point numbers thats directly passed to cava
        // they are passed in order that they are defined
        eq: []
    ),
    ```

3.  Configure the pane layout to include Cava. This goes in your `config.ron` under the tabs section. Below is
    an example of how to add a Cava pane split alongside the queue and album art:

    ```rust
    tabs: [
        (
            name: "Queue",
            pane: Split(
                direction: Horizontal,
                panes: [
                    (size: "40%", pane: Pane(AlbumArt)),
                    (size: "60%", pane: Split(
                        direction: Vertical,
                        panes: [
                            (size: "50%", pane: Pane(Queue)),
                            (size: "50%", pane: Pane(Cava)),
                        ],
                    )),
                ],
            ),
        ),
    ],
    ```

    See <a href={path("configuration/tabs#panes")}>Panes documentation</a> for more information about configuring panes.

</Steps>

## Theming

The look of visualiser can be configured in your <a href={path("configuration/theme#cava")}>theme</a>
(not in `config.ron`). Below are possible options.

:::caution
Please read the comments carefully as the example does not work copy/paste out of the box.
:::

```rust
cava: (
    // symbols that will be used to draw the bar in the visualiser, in ascending order of
    // fill fraction
    bar_symbols: ['‚ñÅ', '‚ñÇ', '‚ñÉ', '‚ñÑ', '‚ñÖ', '‚ñÜ', '‚ñá', '‚ñà'],
    // similar to bar_symbols but these are used for the top-down rendering, meaning for orientation
    // "Horizontal" and "Top"
    inverted_bar_symbols: ['‚ñî', 'üÆÇ', 'üÆÉ', '‚ñÄ', 'üÆÑ', 'üÆÖ', 'üÆÜ', '‚ñà'],

    bg_color: "black", // background color, defaults to rmpc's bg color if not provided
    bar_width: 1, // width of a single bar in columns
    bar_spacing: 1, // free space between bars in columns

    // Possible values are "Top", "Bottom" and "Horizontal". Top makes the bars go from top to
    // bottom, "Bottom" is from bottom up, and "Horizontal" is split in the middle with bars going
    // both down and up from there.
    // Using non-default symbols with "Top" and "Horizontal" may produce undesired output.
    orientation: Bottom,

    // Colors can be configured in three different ways: a single color, different colors
    // per row and a gradient. You can use the same colors as everywhere else. Only specify
    // one of these:

    // Every bar symbol will be red
    bar_color: Single("red"),

    // The first two rows(two lowest amplitudes) will be red, after that two green rows
    // and the rest will be blue. You can have as many as you want here. The last value
    // will be used if the height exceeds the length of this array.
    bar_color: Rows([
        "red",
        "red",
        "green",
        "green",
        "blue",
    ])

    // A simple color gradient. This is a map where keys are percent values of the height
    // where the color starts. After that it is linearly interpolated towards the next value.
    // In this example, the color will start at green for the lowest amplitudes, go towards
    // blue at half amplitudes and finishing as red for the highest values. Keys must be between
    // 0 and 100 and if the first or last key are not 0 and 100 respectively, the lowest and highest
    // value will be used as 0 and 100. Only hex and RGB colors are supported here and your terminal
    // must support them as well!
    bar_color: Gradient({
          0: "rgb(  0, 255,   0)",
         50: "rgb(  0,   0, 255)",
        100: "rgb(255,   0,   0)",
    })
),
```

Rmpc uses [ron](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) format for its configuration file. The file can be located at:

-   `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rmpc/config.ron`
-   `$HOME/.config/rmpc/config.ron`
-   `Specific path specified by the --config flag`

## Bootstrapping a config file

Config file can be bootstrapped by running the following command:

```bash frame=none showLineNumbers=false
rmpc config > ~/.config/rmpc/config.ron
```

## Config file structure

Below is a list of properties that can be changed.

### address

<ConfigValue name="address" type={['"<ip>:<port>"', '"/path/to/socket"']} />

The address to connect to. Address can be either an IP address with a port or a UNIX domain socket path.

The order of precedence is as follows:

1. `--address` and `--password` passed to rmpc as command line arguments
2. `$MPD_HOST` and `$MPD_PORT` environment variables
    - If `$MPD_PORT` is not provided and `$MPD_HOST` starts with `~` or `/`, it is assumed to be a path to a unix socket
    - If `$MPD_PORT` is not provided and `$MPD_HOST` is an IP address and, the default port of `6600` is used
    - Password can be provided via `$MPD_HOST` in the `password@host` format.
3. The `address` and `password` values from config file
4. And finally, if none of the above are provided, the default of `127.0.0.1:6600` is used

Address and password from different sources cannot be mixed and matched.

#### album_display_mode

Can be one of the following:

-   `SplitByDate` - songs in the album will be split into separate album entries, one for each date and the
    album date will be displayed in front of the album name in the following format: `(<date value>) <album name>`
-   `NameOnly` - only one entry for an album will be created and the album date will not be displayed

#### album_sort_by

Can be one of the following:

-   `Name` - albums are sorted by their name first and date second if their names are identical
-   `Date` - albums will be simply sorted by date.

:::caution

Rmpc does not do any processing on the `date` metadata tag on the song. It gets sorted lexicographically.

Panes can be used either in your layout or in your tabs. They allow you to control what is displayed
where and mix and match them to your liking.

## Panes

Rmpc has several pane_types which can be displayed. These are:

- `AlbumArt` - The album art. Cannot be focused.
- `Cava` - Displays a music visualiser using Cava. More info on its own <a href={path("configuration/cava")}>page</a>.
- `Queue` - Table of the current song queue.
- `Directories` - Browse music library by directory.
- `Browser` - A music library browser. Allows you to specify a root tag and an optional separator. `Browser(root_tag: "<tag>", separator: ";")`.
  Separator can be used to create multiple entries from one tag value, for example if a song has multiple `genre` values separated by `;`.
- `Artists` - Browse music library by `artist` tag. Equivalent to `Browser(root_tag: "artist")`
- `AlbumArtists` - Browse music library by `albumartist` tag. Equivalent to `Browser(root_tag: "albumartist")`
- `Albums` - Browse music library by `album` tag.
- `Playlists` - Browse saved playlists.
- `Search` - Search music library.
- `Lyrics` - Display synced lyrics.
- `ProgressBar` - Displays the progress of the currently playing song
- `Header` - Displays various information about the current song and MPD's states, configurable in your theme
- `Tabs` - Displays a simple tab bar showing what tabs are available and which one is active
- `Property` - A special pane which can display a list of <a href={path("configuration/properties")}>properties</a>
  including styling, default values etc. Check the [Example](#property) for more info.
- `Volume` - Interactive volume slider with mouse support. Supports `Volume(kind: Slider(<config>))` configuration. More info in the [Example](#volume)

### Property

<ConfigValue
    name="Property"
    customText="Pane(Property(content: <property[]>, align: <Left | Right | Center>, scroll_speed: <number>))"
/>

The property pane, can be used to display one or more <a href={path("configuration/properties")}>properties</a>.
The content of the pane can be aligned in case the pane's size is bigger than its content. The content
can also wrap scroll around in case it does not fit the pane's size, this is controlled by the
`scroll_speed`.

#### Example

Displays the currently elapsed time followed with a forward slash and the current song's total
duration. After that a `Group` is used to show song's bitrate in the format `(999 kbps)`, the group
ensures that no parentheses will be shown if the bitrate cannot be determined.
The text will also wrap scroll if the pane is not big enough for the content.

```rust
Pane(Property(
    content: "$elapsed ' / ' $cduration [' (' $bitrate ' kbps)']",
    align: Right,
    scroll_speed: 1,
)),
```

or equivalent:

```rust
Pane(Property(
    content: [
        (kind: Property(Status(Elapsed))),
        (kind: Text(" / ")),
        (kind: Property(Status(Duration))),
        (kind: Group([
            (kind: Text(" (")),
            (kind: Property(Status(Bitrate))),
            (kind: Text(" kbps)")),
        ])),
    ],
    align: Right,
    scroll_speed: 1,
)),
```

### Browser

<ConfigValue name="Browser" customText="Pane(Browser(root_tag: <string>, separator: <string | None>))" />

A browser pane where the root level will be list of all `root_tag` values in your music database.
The second level will all albums under that tag and the third and final level will be list of songs
in the given album.

Separator allows you to synthesize multiple tags from a single value by splitting the value at the
separator. The separator is optional and can be omitted.

For example: `Pane(Browser(root_tag: "genre", separator: "/"))` will show all genres in your music
library at the root level, if any song has genre value of "genre1/genre2" then "genre1" and "genre2"
will show as separate entries.

### Volume

<ConfigValue name="Volume" customText="Pane(Volume(kind: Slider(<config>)))" />

The Volume pane provides an interactive volume slider with mouse support. You can click to set volume directly or use scroll wheel to adjust volume in steps.

Currently, only the `Slider` kind is supported.

<ConfigValue
    name="kind"
    customText="Slider(symbols: <symbols[]>, track_style: <style>, filled_style: <style>, thumb_style: <style>)"
/>

Configure the appearance of the volume slider:

- `symbols` - Array of 5 strings defining the visual elements: `[start, filled, thumb, empty, end]`
    - `start` - Symbol at the beginning of the slider (default: "‚ô™")
    - `filled` - Symbol for the filled portion (default: "‚îÄ")
    - `thumb` - Symbol for the current position indicator (default: "‚óè")
    - `empty` - Symbol for the empty portion (default: "‚îÄ")
    - `end` - Symbol at the end of the slider (default: "‚ô´")

- `filled_style` - Style for the filled portion of the slider (default: blue foreground)
- `thumb_style` - Style for the thumb/position indicator (default: blue foreground)
- `track_style` - Style for the empty portion of the slider (default: dark gray foreground)

#### Example

```rust
Volume(
    kind: Slider(
        symbols: ["üîà", "‚îÅ", "‚óè", "‚îÅ", "üîä"],
        track_style: (fg: "gray"),
        filled_style: (fg: "green"),
        thumb_style: (fg: "white", bg: "green"),
    )
)
```

This creates a volume slider with speaker icons at the ends, using green for the filled portion and a white thumb with green background.

### Header

:::note
Do not use this pane. Use the layout and `Property` panes instead.
:::

<ConfigValue name="header" type="other" customText="<row[]>" link="#row" />
Configuration of the header. Header is displayed at the top of the window. It can display info about current song, the
player state and custom widgets. It is an array of `row` objects. The number of these rows determines how many rows are
going to be displayed in the header. If left empty, the header is not displayed at all. Each row can have left, center
and right configuration to display various information about the player state and currently playing song.

#### row

<ConfigValue type="other" customText="(left: <property>, center: <property>, right: <property>)" />
Defines a single row in the header. Each row can have left, center and right configuration.

#### property

Describes a single segment (left, center or right) of the header. More info in
the <a href={path("configuration/properties")}>properties</a> page.

You can use the so called properties in various places in rmpc. These allow you to customize what
information is shown and how the program looks as a whole. These properties are usable in
the <a href={path("configuration/layout")}>layout</a>, <a href={path("configuration/tabs")}>tabs</a>, <a href={path("configuration/theme/#browser_song_format")}>browser_song_format</a>
and <a href={path("configuration/layout#components")}>components</a>.

## Definition

Properties can be defined by either composing struct using the `ron` format or via a custom
templating syntax. These two types of definition are equivalent and you are free to choose which one
you prefer but using templates is advised for convenience and future extensibility.

## Available property types

The properties are divided into a few categories:

- `Text` - Displays a raw text value.
- `Sticker` - Display sicker value of a song. These stickers can be used to for example track
    <a href={path("guides/on_song_change/#track-song-play-count")}>play count</a> of songs.
- `Property` - Display song's metadata values or information about rmpc's and MPD's status. These
  properties are further divided into three categories:
    - `Song` - Display metadata of either the currently playing song or controls format of songs in
      lists and tables depending on the context.
    - `Status` - Display rmpc's or MPD's status like the playback state, volume, currently active tab
      and others.
    - `Widget` - A bit more involved properties with custom display options, these are mostly
      obsolete nowadays and kept for backwards compatibility.
- `Group` - Groups one or more properties together. If any of the properties resolves to an empty value
  the whole group will not be shown.
- `Transform` - Applies a transformation on the properties in question like truncating the value to
  a specified number of characters.

## Template definition syntax

Text is simply a string surrounded by either double or single quotes. If you want to put literal
quotes symbol inside your text you can do so by escaping it with `\`.

Properties and stickers are denoted by a leading `$` followed by its name. Some of these
properties take parameters which are defined inside parentheses by first specifying the parameter
name followed by a `:` and then its value. These parameters can be of several types: simple string
values, styles, numbers, booleans and other properties.

Groups are denoted by square brackets `[]` inside which you can put one or more other properties.

Transforms are similar to properties except they use `%` instead of `$`.

Styles are denoted using curly braces `{}` inside which you can specify one of `fg`, `bg` or `mods`
which set the foreground color, background color and text modifiers respectively. Supported colors
are the same as everywhere else, meaning the 16 terminal colors, ANSI colors, RGB and HEX values.
Modifiers are also the same and possible values are `b`, `d`, `i`, `u`, `r` and `x` for bold, dim,
italic, underlined, reversed and crossed out respectively. Multiple modifiers can be specified at
once, ie. `mods: biu` for bold, italic and underlined.

Fallback values can also be configured by putting a pipe symbol `|` after the property definition
followed by another property which is to be used if the first one does not exist. For example to
fallback to filename when song's metadata is missing a title.

## Lyrics

Rmpc supports displaying [synchronized lyrics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)>) in the `Lyrics` pane.
Other lyrics formats are not supported. The `lyrics_dir` must be configured for the resolution to work. All `lrc` files
must be on the client side.

### LRC file format

LRC files are text files with a specific structure:

```
[ar:Artist Name]
[ti:Song Title]
[al:Album Name]
[length:03:45.12]
[offset:1000]

[00:12.34]First line of lyrics
[00:15.67]Second line of lyrics
[01:23.45]Another line...
```

#### What gets parsed and what gets ignored

**Metadata tags** (at the beginning of file):

- `[ar:Artist Name]` - Artist name (required for matching)
- `[ti:Song Title]` - Song title (required for matching)
- `[al:Album Name]` - Album name (optional)
- `[au:Author Name]` - Author/lyricist name (optional)
- `[length:3:45]` - Song length (helps with matching)
- `[offset:-500]` - Time adjustment in milliseconds

**Timestamp lines** (lyrics with timing):

- `[00:12.34]First line of lyrics`
- `[1:23.45]Second line` (single digit minutes work)
- `[00:30.5]Third line` (different decimal places work)
- `[01:30.00][02:30.00]Repeated chorus` (multiple timestamps per line)
- `[00:10.00][Intro] Welcome` (non-timestamp content like `[Intro]` becomes part of lyrics)

**What gets ignored:**

- `# Comments like this`
- `[custom:unknown tags]`
- `[tool:editor name]`
- `[abc:30.00]Invalid timestamp` (invalid minutes/seconds)
- `Lines without brackets`
- `[unclosed bracket`
- Empty lines

### Lrc file resolution

Lrc files are resolved by rmpc via two methods (in order):

- Same path as the song file, except with the `.lrc` file extension
- By indexing all the `.lrc` files in the `lyrics_dir`

#### Lyrics index

Rmpc will create an index of all `.lrc` files in your `lyrics_dir` on startup.

**How songs match to LRC files:**

- Artist and title must match exactly (case insensitive)
- Album is optional - if present in both, it must match
- If LRC has a length tag, it must be within Â±5 seconds of song length

**Unknown tags are ignored:** `[by:Creator]`, `[tool:Editor]`, `[version:1.0]`, etc.

#### Same path as the song file

Following examples assume that your MPD's music directory is set to `/home/user/Music`.

1. If your `lyrics_dir` is set to the same path as MPD's music directory
   `/home/user/Music/artist/album/song.flac` will try to resolve `/home/user/Music/artist/album/song.lrc`

2. If your `lyrics_dir` is set to a different path, ie. `/home/user/.lyrics`
   `/home/user/Music/artist/album/song.flac` will try to resolve `/home/user/.lyrics/artist/album/song.lrc`

### Example LRC file

```
# This is a comment - ignored
[ti:My Song]
[ar:Artist Name]
[al:Album Name]
[length:3:45]
[offset:-500]
[custom:unknown tag]  # ignored

[00:00.00]Intro starts here
[00:12.34]First verse line
[00:15.67]Second verse line
[00:30.00][01:30.00]This chorus repeats twice
[00:45.5]Different decimal format works
[01:00.00]Lyrics with Ã©mojis ðŸŽµ work fine
[01:20.00]Text with [brackets] works too
[01:30.00][Intro] This text becomes part of lyrics
[01:35.00]
[abc:30.00]Invalid timestamp - ignored
This line has no brackets - ignored
[02:00.00]Back to lyrics
```

**What rmpc sees in this example:**

- **Song info:** "My Song" by "Artist Name" from "Album Name"
- **Timing:** All timestamps shifted 500ms earlier (offset)
- **Lyrics:** 9 lines with valid timestamps (invalid lines skipped)
- **Ignored:** Comments, unknown tags, invalid timestamps

### Important Notes for Users

**What works:**

- Most LRC files from any source work without modification
- Files with some parsing errors still work - only invalid lines are skipped
- Large timestamp values are supported (up to 99:59.99)

**For best results:**

- Use standard `[MM:SS.xx]` format for timestamps
- Include `[ar:]` (artist) and `[ti:]` (title) tags for proper song matching
- Files with no valid timestamps will appear empty in the lyrics pane
- Only consecutive timestamps at the start of a line are parsed - everything after the first non-timestamp tag becomes lyrics content

**Troubleshooting:**

- If lyrics don't show up, check that artist/title metadata matches your song
- Missing or mismatched metadata prevents automatic matching
- Lines like `[00:10.00][tag:value][00:12.00]text` will create one line at 10.00s with content `[tag:value][00:12.00]text` - only consecutive timestamps are parsed

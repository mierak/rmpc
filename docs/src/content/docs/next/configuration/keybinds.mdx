## Keybinds

<ConfigValue
    name="keybinds"
    type="other"
    customText="(global: <kebyinds_map>, navigation: <keybinds_map>, queue: <keybinds_map>)"
/>

Keybinds are configured in the config file. There are different keybinds for different panes and actions. Keybinds are
optional and do not have be specified in the config file. If omitted the default keybinds below are used. By default the
keybinds are vim-like, but you can change them to whatever you want.

Rmpc supports kitty's keyboard protocol, meaning you can use advanced key combinations like mixing
modifier keys such as control and shift in one keybind. You must be running supported terminal.
This does not work in tmux. See [kitty's site](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/)
for more info.

:::note
All configured keybinds can also be triggered remotely using the `rmpc remote keybind` command.

## keybinds_map

<ConfigValue name="global" type="other" customText='{ "p": Play, "s": Stop, "X": Stop, ...}' />

Is a simple list of key-value pairs where the left side is key to use specified as a string and the right side is a name of the action.
You can also bind multiple keys to a single action by specifying it multiple times with a different key.

## Keybind syntax

Keybind syntax is similar to vim keybinds. To map action to letter `a` you write `a` and to map an action to an uppercase `A`
you would write `A`. To combine `a` key with a modifiers like `Ctrl` you would write `<C-a>` and likewise for an uppercase
`A`: `<C-A>`. If a special key like `Tab` is used on its own you have to wrap it angle brackets like so: `<Tab>`.
In case of the `Alt` key (sometimes also called `Meta` key) you would write `<A-x>`.

### ExternalCommand

`ExternalCommand(command: ["/path/to/my/script.sh", "arg1", "arg2"], description: "Description to show in Help modal.")`

Can be used to bind any script/shell command to a key. This command gets info about MPD's and rmpc's state as environment variables.
All song paths are listed as their path relative to MPD's music directory.

#### Environment

- `$CURRENT_SONG`: can be used to access the currently playing song.
- `$STATE`: Can be one of `Playing`, `Paused` or `Stopped`
- All metadata of the currently playing song (if any). For example `ARTIST`, `TITLE`, `DURATION`,
- `$SELECTED_SONGS`: contains a list of songs that are selected in the various panes. Songs are separated by `\n`, their order is undefined
  and should not be relied upon.
    - In `Browser`, `Albums`, `Playlists` and `Artists` it will list all songs contained in the currently highlighted item and all its subdirectories.
      If the item is a single song, only that one song will be present. If you mark multiple directories/songs, all of them will be listed
      in `$SELECTED_SONGS`.
    - In `Queue`, only the song under cursor will be listed.
    - In `Search`, While on the search stage, all the songs will be listed and while on the song list stage, only the song under cursor or
      all marked songs will be listed.

## Default keybinds

Below you can find list of all the possible actions along with a short description and their default values.

### Global

These keybinds work everywhere (except when a modal is active) and are used to control things like playback, navigation
between different tabs and exiting rmpc.

### Navigation

These keybinds are used to navigate the different tabs and to interact with the items on the screen. Also includes
some more advanced ones like moving the cursor up or down half a page, moving the cursor to the top or bottom of the
list and controlling search mode.

#### Rate

A configurable keybind used to rate songs. Allows you to rate either the currently playing song or
the song(s) under cursor in the browser panes and the queue.

A modal window with options to select is displayed instead when no configuration is provided or if
the keybind is directly configured to display a modal.

Must have stickers configured, please check <a href={path("configuration/stickers#rating")}>stickers</a>
page for more information.

:::note
It is highly advised to keep ratings in the 0-10 range. Other MPD clients or some other rmpc
functionality might assume that this is the case and will not work otherwise but rmpc will make no
attempts to stop you.
:::

#### Syntax

`Rate(kind: <kind>, current: <bool>, min_rating: <number>, max_rating: <number>)`

Possible values for the action `<kind>` are either a `Modal`, `Value`, `Like()`, `Neutral()`
or `Dislike()`.
These mean:

- Modal - display a menu modal with possible options, takes a list of values to show for rating
  selector, whether to show a text input for custom rating and whether to show like options
- Value - set rating value directly
- Like - set liked state directly
- Neutral - set neutral state directly
- Dislike - set disliked state directly

The rating is applied to the currently playing song if any when `current` is set to true.

Min and max rating are 0 and 10 respectively by default if not provided.

##### Examples

- Set currently rating of the currently playing song to 6

```rust showLineNumbers=false
Rate(kind: Value(6), current: true),
```

- Set rating of song(s) under the cursor in either queue or the browser panes to 3.

```rust showLineNumbers=false
Rate(kind: Value(3), current: false),
// or equivalent
Rate(kind: Value(3)),
```

- Set liked state of the song(s) under the cursor in either queue or the browser panes directly

```rust showLineNumbers=false
Rate(kind: Like(), current: false),
Rate(kind: Neutral(), current: false),
Rate(kind: Dislike(), current: false),
```

- Open a modal which shows options to set rating (0-10) of the currently playing song as well as
  input a custom value or clear the rating completely and options to like the song.

```rust showLineNumbers=false
Rate(kind: Modal(values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], custom: true, like: true), current: false),
// or equivalent
Rate(kind: Modal(), current: false),
```

- Open a modal which shows only text input for rating

```rust showLineNumbers=false
Rate(kind: Modal(values: [], custom: true), current: false),
```

- Open a modal which shows only text input for rating and allows you to set rating up to 100

```rust showLineNumbers=false
Rate(kind: Modal(values: [], custom: true), current: false, max_rating: 100),
```

- Open a modal which shows only the like options

```rust showLineNumbers=false
Rate(kind: Modal(values: [], custom: false, like: true), current: false),
```

#### AddOptions

A configurable keybind to add items to the the queue. Allows you to add either a single or all items,
select a position at which they will be added as well as to choose whether you want to automatically
play the added items.

A modal window with options to select is displayed instead when no configuration is provided or if
the keybind is directly configured to display a modal.

##### Syntax

`AddOptions(kind: <kind>)`

Possible values for the action `<kind>` are either a `Modal` or `Action`. Where `Modal` takes a list of
tuples of a label and the action configuration and `Action` takes just a single action configuration.

Possible `position`s are: `StartOfQueue`, `EndOfQueue`, `BeforeCurrentSong`, `AfterCurrentSong` and
`Replace`.

Possible `autoplay` values are:

- `None` - Do not play added items
- `First` - Play the first added item
- `Hovered` - Play the hovered item after adding. Nothing will be played if no item is hovered or
  you are adding several marked items while hovering over a non-marked item. This works on a best
  effort basis due to technical reasons and only when adding just songs and not directories.
- `HoveredOrFirst` - Same as `Hovered` but if no hovered item could be determined, start playing
  from the `First` item instead.

Possible values for `all`:

- `true` - Add all items in the current directory
- `false` - Add all marked items and only the hovered item if non are marked

##### Examples

- Add a single item or the marked items at the end of the queue

```rust showLineNumbers=false
AddOptions(kind: Action(all: false, autoplay: None, position: EndOfQueue))
```

- Add a single item or the marked items at the start of the queue and start playing from the hovered
  item

```rust showLineNumbers=false
AddOptions(kind: Action(all: false, autoplay: Hovered, position: StartOfQueue))
```

- Add a single item or the marked items after the current and start playing from the hovered item
  or from the first item if no item was hovered.

```rust showLineNumbers=false
AddOptions(kind: Action(all: false, autoplay: HoveredOrFirst, position: AfterCurrentSong))
```

- Open a modal window with the default configuration

```rust showLineNumbers=false
AddOptions()
```

- Open a modal window with the configured options

```rust showLineNumbers=false
AddOptions(kind: Modal([
    ("End of queue and play", (all: false, autoplay: First, position: EndOfQueue),
    ("After the current song", (all: false, autoplay: None, position: AfterCurrentSong),
]))
```

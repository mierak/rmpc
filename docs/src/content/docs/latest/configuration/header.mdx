<ConfigValue name="header" type="other" customText="<row[]>" link="#row" />
Configuration of the header. Header is displayed at the top of te window. It can display info about current song, the
player state and custom widgets. It is an array of `row` objects. The number of these rows determines how many rows are
going to be displayed in the header. If left empty, the header is not displayed at all. Each row can have left, center
and right configuration to display various information about the player state and currently playing song.

## row

<ConfigValue type="other" customText="(left: <header_property>, center: <header_property>, right: <header_property>)" />
Defines a single row in the header. Each row can have left, center and right configuration.

## header_property

Describes a single segment (left, center or right) of the header. This is a recursive data structure. Whenever a
property is not present, the `default` fallback is used. This fallback can also have a default value.

### kind

<ConfigValue name="kind" type="other" customText="<header_property_kind>" link="#header_property_kind" />
What property to display. Described in [its own section](#header_property_kind)

### style

<ConfigValue name="style" type="other" customText="<style>" />
Style for the property.

### default

<ConfigValue name="default" type="other" customText="<header_property>" />
This is a normal [header property](#header_property). It is used as a fallback value when the current property is not
defined

## header_property_kind

Kind can be one of two values, static `Text` or `Property` which can display song metadata, various player status info
or predefined widgets.

### Text

<ConfigValue name="kind" type="other" customText='Text("<string>")' />
Will display static text in the table. Mostly useful for default values. For example if a song is missing an album tag,
"Unknown Album" can be displayed by specifying `Text("Unknown Album")` as the default.

### Property

<ConfigValue name="kind" type={["Property(Song(...))", "Property(Status(...)))", "Property(Widget(...)))"]} />
Can display values from currently playing song metadata, just like in the
<a href={path("configuration/song-table/#property")}>song table</a>, info about the player status (volume, playing or
stopped, current bitrate, ...) or a predefined widget.

### Property(Song)

<ConfigValue
    name="kind"
    type={[
        "Property(Song(Filename))",
        "Property(Song(Title))",
        "Property(Song(Artist))",
        "Property(Song(Album))",
        "Property(Song(Duration))",
        'Property(Song(Other("<String>")))',
    ]}
/>
This is similar to the `SongProperty` but is used for the header. It can display information about the song that is
currently playing. The `Other` variant can be used to display any tag, even those not explicitly supported by rmpc.

### Property(Status)

<ConfigValue
    name="kind"
    type={[
        "Property(Song(Volume))",
        "Property(Song(Repeat))",
        "Property(Song(Random))",
        "Property(Song(Single))",
        "Property(Song(Consume))",
        "Property(Song(State))",
        "Property(Song(Elapsed))",
        "Property(Song(Duration))",
        "Property(Song(Crossfade))",
        "Property(Song(Bitrate))",
    ]}
/>
These values display the current state of the player. For example, `Volume` will display the current volume, `Repeat`
will display if the repeat mode is on or off, etc.

### Property(Widget)

<ConfigValue
    name="Property"
    type={["Property(Widget(Volume))", "Property(Widget(States(active_style: <style>, separator_style: <style>)))"]}
/>
These are predefined "widgets" which you can use in your header. They differ from regular properties in that they can
have additional styling options or display options.

#### Volume widget

<ConfigValue name="kind" type="other" customText="Property(Widget(Volume))" />
Shows volume with percentage and bars instead of just simple number. It looks something like this: `Volume: ▁▂▃▄▅▆▇
100%`

#### States widget

<ConfigValue
    name="kind"
    type="other"
    customText="Property(Widget(States(active_style: <style>, separator_style: <style>)))"
/>
Offers additional styling for active and inactive state. Looks like this: Repeat / Random / Consume / Single. Where the
active states are highlighted with the active style and the inactive states are highlighted with the inactive style. The
'/' is highlighted with the separator style.

## Example

This configuration displays a header with single row. On the left side there is player state (Playing/Paused/Stopped) in
yellow color inside brackets, ie. `[Playing]`. In the center there is the title of the currently playing song in bold.
If there is no song playing, the text "No Song" is displayed. And on the right side there is the volume widget in blue
color.

```rust
header: (
    rows: [
        (
            left: [
                (kind: Text("["), style: (fg: "yellow", modifiers: "Bold")),
                (kind: Property(Status(State)), style: (fg: "yellow", modifiers: "Bold")),
                (kind: Text("]"), style: (fg: "yellow", modifiers: "Bold"))
            ],
            center: [
                (kind: Property(Song(Title)), style: (modifiers: "Bold"),
                    default: (kind: Text("No Song"), style: (modifiers: "Bold"))
                )
            ],
            right: [
                (kind: Property(Widget(Volume)), style: (fg: "blue"))
            ]
        )
    ],
),
```

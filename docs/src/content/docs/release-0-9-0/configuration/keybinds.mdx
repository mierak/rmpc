## Keybinds

<ConfigValue
    name="keybinds"
    type="other"
    customText="(global: <kebyinds_map>, navigation: <keybinds_map>, queue: <keybinds_map>)"
/>

Keybinds are configured in the config file. There are different keybinds for different panes and actions. Keybinds are
optional and do not have be specified in the config file. If omitted the default keybinds below are used. By default the
keybinds are vim-like, but you can change them to whatever you want.

## keybinds_map

<ConfigValue name="global" type="other" customText='{ "p": Play, "s": Stop, "X": Stop, ...}' />

Is a simple list of key-value pairs where the left side is key to use specified as a string and the right side is a name of the action.
You can also bind multiple keys to a single action by specifying it multiple times with a different key.

## Keybind syntax

Keybind syntax is similar to vim keybinds. To map action to letter `a` you write `a` and to map an action to an uppercase `A`
you would write `A`. To combine `a` key with a modifiers like `Ctrl` you would write `<C-a>` and likewise for an uppercase
`A`: `<C-A>`. If a special key like `Tab` is used on its own you have to wrap it angle brackets like so: `<Tab>`.
In case of the `Alt` key (sometimes also called `Meta` key) you would write `<A-x>`.

### ExternalCommand

`ExternalCommand(command: ["/path/to/my/script.sh", "arg1", "arg2"], description: "Description to show in Help modal.")`

Can be used to bind any script/shell command to a key. This command gets info about MPD's and rmpc's state as environment variables.
All song paths are listed as their path relative to MPD's music directory.

#### Environment

- `$CURRENT_SONG`: can be used to access the currently playing song.
- `$STATE`: Can be one of `Playing`, `Paused` or `Stopped`
- All metadata of the currently playing song (if any). For example `ARTIST`, `TITLE`, `DURATION`,
- `$SELECTED_SONGS`: contains a list of songs that are selected in the various panes. Songs are separated by `\n`, their order is undefined
  and should not be relied upon.
    - In `Browser`, `Albums`, `Playlists` and `Artists` it will list all songs contained in the currently highlighted item and all its subdirectories.
      If the item is a single song, only that one song will be present. If you mark multiple directories/songs, all of them will be listed
      in `$SELECTED_SONGS`.
    - In `Queue`, only the song under cursor will be listed.
    - In `Search`, While on the search stage, all the songs will be listed and while on the song list stage, only the song under cursor or
      all marked songs will be listed.

## Default keybinds

Below you can find list of all the possible actions along with a short description and their default values.

### Global

These keybinds work everywhere (except when a modal is active) and are used to control things like playback, navigation
between different tabs and exiting rmpc.

### Navigation

These keybinds are used to navigate the different tabs and to interact with the items on the screen. Also includes
some more advanced ones like moving the cursor up or down half a page, moving the cursor to the top or bottom of the
list and controlling search mode.

<ConfigValue name="tabs" customText="<tab[]>" />

Provides an abiliy to configure what tabs are shown by rmpc. Each tab contains one or more panes. Panes
can be laid out how you want by splitting them via nesting multiple pane layouts. Each `pane_type` can be
displayed multiple times in one or more tabs, but ultimately it is a single instance of the given pane.
Check out the <a href={path("reference/config/")}>default config</a> for reference.

## tab

<ConfigValue name="tab" customText='(name: "<string>", pane: Pane | Split | Component)' />

A single tab that will be shown by rmpc. Each tab has a name that is displayed in the tab bar and either a single or multiple `Pane`s.

### name

<ConfigValue name="name" type="string" />

Each tab has a name which will be displayed in the tab bar and can be used in the `SwitchToTab(<name>)` keybind.

### pane

<ConfigValue name="pane" type={["Pane", "Split", "Component"]} link="#pane--split--component" />

`pane_type` to display in the given Pane. Can be etither `Split` or `Pane`. `Split` means that given pane will be split
into multiple sub panes. `Pane` simply displays the given `pane_type`.

## Pane | Split | Component

- `Pane(<pane_type>)` - Displays the given pane type itself.
- `Split(direction: Horizontal | Vertical, borders: <borders>, panes: <sub_panes[]>)` splits the pane into multiple sub panes. Each split has
  a direction and a list of sub panes. More info on borders in [their section](#borders).
- `Component("<component_name>")` - Displays a <a href={path("configuration/layout#components")}>component</a>

### direction

<ConfigValue name="direction" type={["Horizontal", "Vertical"]} />

Determines which direction the pane will be split into.

### panes

<ConfigValue name="panes" customText="(size: '50%', borders: <borders>, pane: Split() | Pane(<pane_type>)" />

Sub panes for the given split. The size can be either percent (`50%`), exact value(`3`) or a
ratio (`0.4r`).

- Exact value will reserve exactly that many rows/columns
- Percent value will reserve that portion of available space
- Ratio will take parent container's other size (if you are splitting horizontally it will take
  parent's height and if vertically then it will take parent's width) and multiply it with this number.
  The result is then rounded and used as an exact size. Useful to for example keep `AlbumArt` as
  square size at all times. Note that the sizes here are in terminal cell width/height and not pixels.

Each sub pane can be either a `Pane` or another `Split`. Sub pane can also have borders, more info in [their section](#borders).

## pane_type

Rmpc has several pane_types which can be displayed. These are:

- `AlbumArt` - The album art. Cannot be focused.
- `Cava` - Displays a music visualiser using Cava. More info on its own <a href={path("configuration/cava")}>page</a>.
- `Queue` - Table of the current song queue.
- `Directories` - Browse music library by directory.
- `Browser` - A music library browser. Allows you to specify a root tag and an optional separator. `Browser(root_tag: "<tag>", separator: ";")`.
  Separator can be used to create multiple entries from one tag value, for example if a song has multiple `genre` values separated by `;`.
- `Artists` - Browse music library by `artist` tag. Equivalent to `Browser(root_tag: "artist")`
- `AlbumArtists` - Browse music library by `albumartist` tag. Equivalent to `Browser(root_tag: "albumartist")`
- `Albums` - Browse music library by `album` tag.
- `Playlists` - Browse saved playlists.
- `Search` - Search music library.
- `Lyrics` - Display synced lyrics.
- `ProgressBar` - Displays the progress of the currently playing song
- `Header` - Displays various information about the current song and MPD's states, configurable in your theme
- `Tabs` - Displays a simple tab bar showing what tabs are available and which one is active
- `Property` - A special pane which can display any property as described in the <a href={path("configuration/header/#header_property")}>Header config</a>
  including styling, default values etc. Check the [Example](#property-pane) for more info.

## borders

<ConfigValue name="borders" type={['"NONE"', '"ALL"', '"LEFT"', '"RIGHT"', '"TOP"', '"BOTTOM"']} />

Define what borders are rendered around a tab or one of its panes. Default is `"NONE"`, meaning no borders.
By specifying `"ALL"` the borders will be on all sides of the pane/tab. The above values can also be combined,
if you for example want borders on the left and right, you can achieve it by defining `"LEFT | RIGHT"`.

:::note
Note that you have to account for the borders if you use exact sizing of panes. For example if your Header
is supposed to be 2 rows tall and has borders at TOP and BOTTOM you must set its size as 4.

## Examples

Some tabs config examples below.

### Single border between panes

Single tab with queue and album art, with a border between them and also border around the whole split.

```rust
tabs: [
    (
        name: "Queue",
        pane: Split(
            direction: Horizontal,
            borders: "ALL",
            panes: [
                (
                    size: "40%",
                    borders: "RIGHT",
                    pane: Pane(AlbumArt),
                ),
                (
                    size: "60%",
                    pane: Pane(Queue),
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ),
],
```

### Single pane tab, border on left and right

You have to use `Split` here even for a single pane if you want a border.

```rust
tabs: [
    (
        name: "Tab",
        pane: Split(
            direction: Horizontal,
            borders: "LEFT | RIGHT",
            panes: [
                (
                    size: "100%",
                    pane: Pane(Queue),
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ),
],
```

</details>

### Property pane

<ConfigValue
    name="pane"
    customText="Pane(Property(content: <property>[], align: Left | Right | Center, scroll_speed: <number>))"
    link={path("configuration/header/#header_property_kind")}
/>

This config displays the `AlbumArt` and `Queue` panes and below them there are `Property` with pane with `StateV2`, `ProgressBar` pane and
another `Property` pane with combination of `Elapsed` and `Duration` status properties next to each other in a line.

The `Property` pane also scrolls around and cycles if the content is longer than its defined area when `scroll_speed` is set to a value higher
than 0. The value determines how fast the `Property` pane cycles in columns per second. This is tied to the elapsed time of the currently playing
song. This is disabled when set to 0 or not set at all.

Rmpc uses [ron](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) format for its configuration file. The file can be located at:

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rmpc/config.ron`
- `$HOME/.config/rmpc/config.ron`
- `Specific path specified by the --config flag`

## Bootstrapping a config file

Config file can be bootstrapped by running the following command:

```bash frame=none showLineNumbers=false
rmpc config > ~/.config/rmpc/config.ron
```

## Config file structure

Below is a list of properties that can be changed.

### address

<ConfigValue name="address" type={['"<ip>:<port>"', '"/path/to/socket"']} />

The address to connect to. Address can be either an IP address with a port or a UNIX domain socket path.

The order of precedence is as follows:

1. `--address` and `--password` passed to rmpc as command line arguments
2. `$MPD_HOST` and `$MPD_PORT` environment variables
    - If `$MPD_PORT` is not provided and `$MPD_HOST` starts with `~` or `/`, it is assumed to be a path to a unix socket
    - If `$MPD_PORT` is not provided and `$MPD_HOST` is an IP address and, the default port of `6600` is used
    - Password can be provided via `$MPD_HOST` in the `password@host` format.
3. The `address` and `password` values from config file
4. And finally, if none of the above are provided, the default of `127.0.0.1:6600` is used

Address and password from different sources cannot be mixed and matched.

### password

<ConfigValue name="password" type="string" />

Provide MPD with password upon connecting. Set to `None` or omit completely if your MPD is not configured to use a password.

### cache_dir

<ConfigValue name="cache_dir" type="string" optional />

Directory for rmpc's cache files. Used for files downloaded for youtube and might be used for more in the future.

### lyrics_dir

<ConfigValue name="lyrics_dir" type="string" optional />

Directory where rmpc should search for `lrc` files. Please see the <a href={path("configuration/lyrics")}>lyrics page</a> for more information.

### mpd_read_timeout_ms

<ConfigValue name="mpd_read_timeout_ms" type="number" />

How long to wait for response to MPD command before giving up and reconnecting. Defaults to `10_000` milliseconds.

### mpd_write_timeout_ms

<ConfigValue name="mpd_write_timeout_ms" type="number" />

How long to wait for write to MPD socket to finish before giving up and reconnecting. Defaults to `5_000` milliseconds.

### mpd_idle_read_timeout_ms

<ConfigValue name="mpd_write_timeout_ms" optional type="number" />

By default the client will wait forever for data from MPD to appear while being idle. This makes it timeout after the
specified timeout and try again. Defaults to None.

:::caution
Do not set this option. Only reason to use this is if you are experiencing connection issues and rmpc hanging after a disconnect.
:::

### rewind_to_start_sec

<ConfigValue name="rewind_to_start_sec" optional type="number" />

`PreviousTrack` will rewind to start if elapsed time is past the configured value. `PreviousTrack` will always switch to
the previous track if not configured or set to `None`.

### theme

<ConfigValue optional name="theme" type="string" />

Theme file to use. If set to `None` or absent, the default theme is used. More info at:

<LinkCard
    title="Configuring themes"
    description="Get the default theme file and customize it"
    href={path("configuration/theme/")}
/>

### album_art

<ConfigValue name="album_art" type="other" link={path("configuration/album-art")} />

Various options for album art display. By default should not be needed to be specified. More info at <a href={path("configuration/album-art#configuration")}>album art page</a>

### cava

<ConfigValue name="volume_step" type="number" />

Determines the step when changing volume with the volume up and down keybinds. Default is 5%.

### max_fps

<ConfigValue name="max_fps" type="number" />

Rmpc batches rendered frames to save resources, meaning it could skip a render on input and make the frame
a bit delayed if many frames are requested at the same time. This option sets how many frames rmpc can render
in one second. Default is `30`.

### scrolloff

<ConfigValue name="scrolloff" type="number" />

<ConfigValue name="enable_config_hot_reload" type="bool" />

Whether rmpc should watch its config directory and reload the config when it changes. Most options can be changed during
runtime but some will still require you to restart rmpc. These include things like album art method and MPD connection
information.
Config hot reload is enabled by default.

### status_update_interval_ms

<ConfigValue name="status_update_interval_ms" type="number" optional />

Interval in milliseconds to update the status when a song is playing. Status means song progress, current bitrate, etc.
Default is 1000ms.

### select_current_song_on_change

### center_current_song_on_change

<ConfigValue name="center_current_song_on_change" type="bool" />

:::note
`select_current_song_on_change` must also be set to true for this to work
:::

If set to true, the current song is centered in the queue when it changes while still allowing you to move in the
queue table with your normal [scrolloff](#scrolloff). Defaults to false if not present.

### on_song_change

<ConfigValue name="on_song_change" type="other" customText={'["notify-send", "song changed!"]'} />

### artists

<ConfigValue name="artists" type="other" customText="<artists>" />

Configures how albums are displayed and sorted in the `Artists` and `AlbumArtists` panes. Albums can display either
only its name or include an album's date as well. Additionally, albums can be sorted by their name or date.

Default:

```rust
artists: (
    album_display_mode: SplitByDate,
    album_sort_by: Date,
),
```

#### album_display_mode

Can be one of the following:

- `SplitByDate` - songs in the album will be split into separate album entries, one for each date and the
  album date will be displayed in front of the album name in the following format: `(<date value>) <album name>`
- `NameOnly` - only one entry for an album will be created and the album date will not be displayed

#### album_sort_by

Can be one of the following:

- `Name` - albums are sorted by their name first and date second if their names are identical
- `Date` - albums will be simply sorted by date.

:::caution

Rmpc does not do any processing on the `date` metadata tag on the song. It gets sorted lexicographically.

:::

### browser_song_sort

<ConfigValue name="browser_song_sort" type="other" customText="SongPropertyKind[]" />

Defines how the songs are sorted in the browser panes. This is a list of <a href={path("configuration/song-table/#property-1")}>song properties</a>.
Defaults to `[Disc, Track, Artist, Title]` which means the songs are first sorted by their `Disc` and `Track` numbers, then by `Artist` and by `Title` last.

### directories_sort

<ConfigValue name="directories_sort" type={["ModifiedTime(..)", "Format(..)", "SongFormat(..)"]} />

Determines how the entries are sorted in the directories pane. All of the properties below take
additional config options: `group_by_type` and `reverse` which groups the entries by directories,
songs and playlists and reverse the ordering respectively.

- `Format` - Songs are sorted by their displayed format.
- `SortFormat` - Similar to `Format` but songs are sorted by <a href={path("configuration/#browser_song_sort")}>browser_song_sort</a>.
- `ModifiedTime` - Entries are sorted by their last modified time.

Defaults to `SortFormat(group_by_type: true, reverse: false)`.

### show_playlists_in_browser

<ConfigValue name="show_playlists_in_browser" type={["All", "None", "NonRoot"]} />

Whether to show playlists in browser or not. Possible values:

- `All` - Show all playlists
- `None` - Do not show playlists
- `NonRoot` - Show playlists everywhere except the root directory. This option exists because MPD
  lists all of its playlists as being inside the root directory.

Defaults to `NonRoot`.

### reflect_changes_to_playlist

<ConfigValue name="reflect_changes_to_playlist" type="bool" />

Reflects the changes from queue to the last loaded playlist. Requires MPD 0.24.0 or newer. Defaults to false.

:::caution
The way this works is very simple. Playlist's name is stored by MPD when it is loaded into the queue, even when the queue is
not currently empty! This name is cleared **ONLY** when the queue is completely cleared with the `DeleteAll` queue action.

When any change is made to the queue while any playlist name is stored, the whole playlist is replaced with the current
Queue's contents.

For example you load playlist A, then load playlist B and then make any change to the queue. This will result in playlist
B being equal to playlist A + B + the change you made.

I do not take any responsibility for any unwanted changes to the playlist.

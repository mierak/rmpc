Rmpc provides <a href={path("configuration#on_resize")}>on_resize</a> property in the config file
which can be used to run a command whenever the rmpc resizes.

The usual environmental variables are available to the script with addition of:

- `$PID` - intended for use with the `remote` command and allows it to target specific rmpc instance
- `$COLS` - columns of the new size
- `$ROWS` - rows of the new size

## Change theme for different size

This can be used to for example change your theme on the fly when rmpc is resized.

Save the following script to for example `~/.config/rmpc/scripts/onresize`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [[ $COLS -gt 100 ]]; then
    rmpc remote --pid "$PID" set theme ~/.config/rmpc/themes/big.ron
    rmpc remote --pid "$PID" status "Big theme set"
else
    rmpc remote --pid "$PID" set theme ~/.config/rmpc/themes/small.ron
    rmpc remote --pid "$PID" status "Small theme set"
fi
```

then put following into your config:

```rust
on_resize: ["~/.config/rmpc/scripts/onresize"],

```

Rmpc can play videos from youtube, soundcloud and nicovideo, but needs a little setup before it
can do that. Only single songs can be added at a time.

<Steps>

    1. Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and have it available in your PATH.
    2. Install [yt-dlp's dependencies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies): ffmpeg, ffprobe, python3 and python's mutagen library.
    3. Configure rmpc's cache directory <a href={path("configuration/#cache_dir")}>in your config file</a>
    4. Connect to MPD with a local socket and not IP address.
    5. Execute `rmpc addyt <youtube-url>` or in tui `addyt <youtube-url>` to add a song to the queue.

</Steps>

:::caution
MPD will not be able to add songs from outside its music directory if not connected through local socket.

Rmpc can play videos from youtube, but needs a little setup before it can do that. Only single songs can be added at a time.

<Steps>

    1. Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and have it available in your PATH.
    2. Install yt-dlp's dependencies: ffmpeg and ffprobe.
    3. Configure rmpc's cache directory [in your config file](/rmpc/configuration/#cache_dir)
    4. Connect to MPD with a local socket and not IP address.
    5. Execute `rmpc addyt <youtube-url>` or in tui `addyt <youtube-url>` to add a song to the queue.

</Steps>

:::caution
MPD will not be able to add songs from outside its music directory if not connected through local socket.

:::note
Tested with yt-dlp version 2024.07.25

bind_to_address "/tmp/mpd_socket"

```rust title=rmpc/config.ron frame=terminal
(
    address: "/tmp/mpd_socket",
    cache_dir: Some("/tmp/rmpc/cache"),

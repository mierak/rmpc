Rmpc provides [on_song_change](/rmpc/configuration#on_song_change) property in the config file
which can be used to run a command whenever the song changes. This can be used for various purposes
like showing a desktop notification.

## Desktop notification on song change

Assuming you have a notification daemon with support for images like [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) running.
This method also assumes you have [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed, which is needed to parse the
`JSON` output.

<Steps>
1. Create a script and place it somewhere. For example `~/.config/rmpc/notify`. Below is an example of such script.
Edit it to your needs or create a new one.

    ```bash title=~/.config/rmpc/notify
    #!/usr/bin/env sh

    # Directory where to store temporary data
    TMP_DIR="/tmp/rmpc"

    # Ensure the directory is created
    mkdir -p "$TMP_DIR"

    # Where to temporarily store the album art received from rmpc
    ALBUM_ART_PATH="$TMP_DIR/notification_cover"

    # Path to fallback album art if no album art is found by rmpc/mpd
    # Change this to your needs
    DEFAULT_ALBUM_ART_PATH="$TMP_DIR/default_album_art.jpg"

    # Save album art of the currently playing song to a file
    if ! rmpc albumart --output "$ALBUM_ART_PATH"; then
        # Use default album art if rmpc returns non-zero exit code
        ALBUM_ART_PATH="${DEFAULT_ALBUM_ART_PATH}"
    fi

    # Query info about current song from rmpc and format it with jq
    SONG_INFO=$(rmpc song | jq '"\(.metadata.artist) - \(.metadata.title)"')

    # Send the notification
    notify-send -i "${ALBUM_ART_PATH}" "Now Playing" "$SONG_INFO"
    ```

2.  Make the script executable

    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/.config/rmpc/notify
    ```

3.  In your rmpc's `config.ron` specify [on_song_change](/rmpc/configuration#on_song_change) property
    and point it at location of the script from step 1.

        ```rust title=config.ron
        #![enable(implicit_some)]
        #![enable(unwrap_newtypes)]
        #![enable(unwrap_variant_newtypes)]
        (
            address: "/tmp/mpd_socket",
            on_song_change: ["~/.config/rmpc/notify"],
        ...

        ```

4.  Restart rmpc

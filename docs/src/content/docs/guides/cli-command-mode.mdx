Rmpc also features a basic command line interface to support scripting and headless control of mpd without a need for additional tools.

To view the available commands run `rmpc --help`.

These commands are also available in the TUI mode by pressing `CommandMode` bind (`:` by default).

Additionally, these commands can also be bound to a key using the `Command` action as [described here](/rmpc/configuration/keybinds#global)

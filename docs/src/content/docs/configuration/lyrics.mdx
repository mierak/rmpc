## Lyrics

Rmpc supports displaying [synchronized lyrics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRC_(file_format)>) in the `Lyrics` pane.
Other lyrics formats are not supported. The `lyrics_dir` must be configured for the resolution to work. All `lrc` files
must be on the client side.

### Lrc file resolution

Lrc files are resolved by rmpc via two methods(in order):

-   By indexing all the `.lrc` files in the `lyrics_dir`
-   Same path as the song file, except with the `.lrc` file extension

#### Lyrics index

Rmpc will create an index of all `.lrc` files in your `lyrics_dir` on startup. Lrc files can contain metadata about
the song which they belong to. These metadata can include artist(ar), title(ti) and album(al) as well as length.
`Artist`, `title` and `album` have to exactly(case sensitive) match in song's and lrc's metadata for the song to match.
If the lrc file contains `length`, it is matched to song's length plus or minus 2 seconds.

#### Same path as the song file

Following examples assume that your MPD's music directory is set to `/home/user/Music`.

1. If your `lyrics_dir` is set to the same path as MPD's music directory
   `/home/user/Music/artist/album/song.flac` will try to resolve `/home/user/Music/artist/album/song.lrc`

2. If your `lyrics_dir` is set to a different path, ie. `/home/user/.lyrics`
   `/home/user/Music/artist/album/song.flac` will try to resolve `/home/user/.lyrics/artist/album/song.lrc`

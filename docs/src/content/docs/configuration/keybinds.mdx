## Keybinds

<ConfigValue
    name="keybinds"
    type="other"
    customText="(global: <kebyinds_map>, navigation: <keybinds_map>, queue: <keybinds_map>)"
/>

Keybinds are configured in the config file. There are different keybinds for different screens and actions. Keybinds are
optional and do not have be specified in the config file. If ommited the default keybinds below are used. By default the
keybinds are vim-like, but you can change them to whatever you want.

## keybinds_map

<ConfigValue name="global" type="other" customText='{ "p": Play, "s": Stop, "X": Stop, ...}' />

Is a simple list of key-value pairs where the left side is key to use specified as a string and the right side is a name of the action.
You can also bind multiple keys to a single action by specfying it multiple times with a different key.

## Keybind syntax

Keybind syntax is similar to vim keybinds. To map action to letter `a` you write `a` and to map an action to an uppercase `A`
you would write `A`. To combine `a` key with a modifiers like `Ctrl` you would write `<C-a>` and likewise for an uppercase
`A`: `<C-A>`. If a special key like `Tab` is used on its own you have to wrap it angle brackets like so: `<Tab>`.

## Default keybinds

Below you can find list of all the possible actions along with a short description and their default values.

### Global

These keybinds work everywhere (except when a modal is active) and are used to control things like playback, navigation
between different screens and exiting rmpc.

Currently there are three methods which rmpc can use to display images. Each of these methods functions
differently from the other and have their own advantages, disadvantages and quirks. The preffered and
default method is `Kitty`. Special thanks to yazi for some inspirtion on detecting different kinds of terminals.

The method can be overriden in the config file. Please refer to the [Configuration](#method) for more information.

## Supported terminals

If your terminal is not listed here and you experience issues. Please disable the image method in the [config file](#method).
Some of the terminals do not correctly report their size, thus some tweaking is needed. For those you need to set [max_size_px](#max_size_px).

## Configuration

### method

<ConfigValue name="method" type={["Kitty", "Iterm2", "Sixel", "UeberzugWayland", "UeberzugX11", "None", "Auto"]} />

Rendering method used to display images. Currently Kitty, UeberzugWayland and UeberzugX11 are supported.
Defaults to `Auto` which tries to use Kitty first and then Ueberzug if Kitty is not available.

`None` completely disables album art display.

### max_size_px

<ConfigValue name="max_size_px" type="other" customText="(<width>, <height>)" />

Sets limit for the album art size. If the album art is larger than this, it will be resized to fit the limit.
You should not set this option unless needed because preferred image methods will figure out the correct size
themselves. This is needed only for terminals that do not report their size correctly. Default is `(600, 600)`.
`(0, 0)` means no practical limit. Ueberzug method is not influenced by this setting.

## Protocols

### Kitty

This method should work out of the box if your terminal supports it. It is a reliable but a little bit slower method.

Cons:

-   Image does not change when using tmux and possibly other methods of multiplexing if the change occurs while the tab is not currently active.

### Ueberzugpp

Requires [ueberzugpp](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp). Art is aligned to the top of the window and not centered.

Pros:

-   In my testing a bit faster than Kitty

Cons:

-   Requires third party dependency
-   Is a separate window on top of the terminal. This might require some additional configuration to make it look good in your environment.
-   Album art has to be hidden completely when modal windows are shown

### Iterm2 Inline image protocol

Supported only in select few terminals and some of them need additional configuration. Works best in WezTerm.

### Sixel

Cons:

-   Has lower color depth than the alternatives.
-   Much lower image size can be transmitted through tmux due to sixel being a very size inefficient protocol.
    Tmux supports only 1MB of data due to its internal buffering limitations. See [more info here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1502#issuecomment-429710887).
    You can limit your image size with [max_size_px](#max_size_px).

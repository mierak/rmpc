Currently there are two methods which rmpc can use to display images. Each of these methods functions
differently from the other and have their own advantages, disadvantages and quirks. The preffered and
default method is `Kitty`.

The method can be overriden in the config file. Please refer to the [general configuration](/rmpc/configuration/#image_method) for more information.

### Kitty

This method should work out of the box if your terminal supports it. It is a reliable but a little bit slower method.

Cons:

-   Image does not change when using tmux and possibly other methods of multiplexing if the change occurs while the tab is not currently active.

### Ueberzugpp

Requires [ueberzugpp](https://github.com/jstkdng/ueberzugpp). Art is aligned to the top of the window and not centered.

Pros:

-   In my testing a bit faster than Kitty

Cons:

-   Requires third party dependency
-   Is a separate window on top of the terminal. This might require some additional configuration to make it look good in your environment.
-   Album art has to be hidden completely when modal windows are shown

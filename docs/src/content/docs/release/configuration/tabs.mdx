<ConfigValue name="tabs" customText="<tab[]>" />

Provides an abiliy to configure what tabs are shown by rmpc. Each tab contains one or more panes. Panes
can be laid out how you want by splitting them via nesting multiple pane layouts. Each `pane_type` can be
displayed multiple times in one or more tabs, but ultimately it is a single instance of the given pane.
Check out the <a href={path("reference/config/")}>default config</a> for reference.

## tab

<ConfigValue name="tab" customText='(name: "<string>", border_type: None | Single | Full, pane: Pane | Split)' />

A single tab that will be shown by rmpc. Each tab has a name that is displayed in the tab bar, the type of border that are
going to be displayed and either a single or multiple `Pane`s.

### name

<ConfigValue name="name" type="string" />

Each tab has a name which will be displayed in the tab bar and can be used in the `SwitchToTab(<name>)` keybind.

### border_type

<ConfigValue name="border_type" type={["None", "Single", "Full"]} />

Kind of borders that will be displayed around each pane. `None` means no borders, `Single` means only borders between
panes and `Full` means borders on each side of each pane. The borders use `highlight_border_style` for the currently
focused pane and `borders_style` for all others.

### pane

<ConfigValue name="pane" type={["Pane", "Split"]} link="#pane--split" />

`pane_type` to display in the given Pane. Can be etither `Split` or `Pane`. `Split` means that given pane will be split
into multiple sub panes. `Pane` simply displays the given `pane_type`.

## Pane | Split

-   `Pane(<pane_type>)` - Displays the given pane type itself.
-   `Split(direction: Horizontal | Vertical, panes: <sub_panes[]>)` splits the pane into multiple sub panes. Each split has
    a direction and a list of sub panes.

### direction

<ConfigValue name="direction" type={["Horizontal", "Vertical"]} />

Determines which direction the pane will be split into.

### panes

<ConfigValue name="panes" customText="(size: '<50%>', pane: Split() | Pane(<pane_type>)" />

Sub panes for the given split. The sizes of sub panes must add up to 100% and size of each individual sub pane cannot be
0%. Each sub pane can be either a `Pane` or another `Split`.

## pane_type

Rmpc has several pane_types which can be displayed. These are:

-   `AlbumArt` - The album art. Cannot be focused.
-   `Queue` - Table of the current song queue.

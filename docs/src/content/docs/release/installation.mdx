Currently only linux is officially supported. Precompiled binary is provided on Github and an AUR package is available for Arch.
To build rmpc yourself you will need to have [rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed. More installation
methods will come in the future.

## Steps

<Steps>

1. Install rmpc using one of the [provided methods](#installation-methods)
2. Setup your config file

    <LinkCard
        title="Configuring rmpc"
        description="Generate sample config file for rmpc and customize it to your liking."
        href={path("configuration")}
    />

3. Run rmpc
    ```bash frame=none showLineNumbers=false
    rmpc
    # or if you want to check out the CLI
    rmpc --help
    ```

</Steps>

:::note
Minimum supported MPD version is 0.23.5. Other versions may work, but you are on your own.

## Packaging status

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/rmpc.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rmpc/versions)

## Installation methods

### Arch Linux

```bash frame=none showLineNumbers=false
pacman -S rmpc
# or
yay -S rmpc-git
```

### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```bash frame=none showLineNumbers=false
zypper install rmpc
```

### NixOS

Add [`rmpc`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&query=rmpc) (available in `nixos-unstable` and `nixos-24.11`) to your `systemPackages` and rebuild.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    rmpc
  ];
}
```

### Precompiled binaries

[//]: <> ( This needs major reworking, but I think it's good enough for now )

Download the precompiled binaries from the github [releases page](https://github.com/mierak/rmpc/releases/latest/).
After it's done downloading, untar the archive, set execute permission and run rmpc.

### Using cargo

```bash frame=none showLineNumbers=false
# compile the latest version from source
cargo install rmpc --locked
# or download precompiled binary with cargo binstall
cargo binstall rmpc
# or compile the latest work in progress version from git
cargo install --git https://github.com/mierak/rmpc --locked
```
